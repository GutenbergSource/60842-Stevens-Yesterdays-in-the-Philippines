      <dc:subject>Philippines -- Description and travel</dc:subject>
      <dc:description>A description of the Philippines by an American who lived in Manila for a few years before the U.S. took over the islands from Spain in 1898, and thus was able to give an idea of how was life before the American occupation. Some of the characterizations of the Filipinos are considered racist by today’ standards.</dc:description>
